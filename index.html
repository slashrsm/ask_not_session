	  <p>Give me pros and cons</p>
	  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
	    Pros:

	    Can influence, less €€ than own, community - learning and collaboration, learning by studying
	    code, lots of experts on the market, security, code quality, balanced efforts

	    Cons:

	    Costs €€, ever. avoids pushing big initiatives as someone else will do it, slow decision process

	  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
	    Pros:

	    Cons:

	    No control, hard to learn if docs are not perfect, lots of €€, code quality questionable

	    You control, you have knowledge about it, security through obscurity

	    Cons:

	    All development on you (unsustainable), lost of €€, core team can leave (no knowlegde),
	    quality of code questionable (QA, reviews, ..) - unless you have huge team, security

	    1. (ab)use, same as proprietary (except €€ and support), pay price when problems arise (5 to 12),

	      Thoughts:
	      - This is among contributors, what about entire community?
	      - 3M+ users on d.o. => fraction contributes (and look what we've achieved)
	      - (you squeeze in 0%) ;)
